## A protocol to verify real-world events on-chain through video

Today businesses and organizations are suffering from a lack of transparency over the verification of real-world events.

Brands may want to verify that the shops execute in-store marketing as per requirements. Town councils and other public offices may wish to involve citizens in proving squatters have taken over abandoned buildings or that road works are being correctly executed. Individuals could desire proof of the existence or state of an Airbnb before booking, hence avoiding unpleasant surprises.

VideOracle sets out to solve these issues through a decentralized and trustless verification protocol. The protocol's architecture is detailed below.
